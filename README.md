# Scribble-Clickable-and-Swappable-Text
This is a sample of how to create hitboxes around text generated by JuJuAdams' "Scribble" for Game Maker. It also includes a mechanism for swapping words in a string. 


Screen displayed on the screen is stored in obj_dialoguemanager
Actual printing and calling of the function you're interested in, locate_substring, is done obj_textbox in the Draw_GUI and Draw_GUI_End events
The variables that locate_substring looks for in the text are temporarily stored in obj_textbox in the Create event.

You can see a demonstration of this mechanic by simply starting the game.

I am a terrible programmer, so please feel free to make suggestions and improvements here.
